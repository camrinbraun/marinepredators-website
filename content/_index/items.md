subtitle= "In the Marine Predators Group, we recognize the conflict between valuable fisheries and sustainable use of marine resources. Central to an effective management scheme is the knowledge of the physical-biological interactions in the ocean that govern the structure and function of pelagic ecosystems. Despite being of critical importance to fisheries management, fundamental uncertainties remain regarding the relevant biotic and abiotic components and processes in open ocean ecosystems. As such, we are driven to: 1) Develop knowledge and tools at the interface of fish biology and oceanography to transform pelagic ecology; 2) Quantify the mechanistic drivers of physical-biological interactions and their influence on the structure and function of open ocean ecosystems; 3) Inform adaptive, ecosystem-based fisheries management in a dynamic ocean."
